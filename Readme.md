# TLS-Client

### Preface

This TLS Client is built upon https://github.com/Carcraftz/fhttp and https://github.com/Carcraftz/utls. Big thanks to
all contributors so far. Sadly it seems that the original repositories are not maintained anymore.

### What is TLS Fingerprinting?

Some people think it is enough to change the user-agent header of a request to let the server think that the client
requesting a resource is a specific browser.
Nowadays this is not enough, because the server might use a technique to detect the client browser which is called TLS
Fingerprinting.

Even tho this article is about TLS Fingerprinting in NodeJS it well describes the technique in general.
https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/tls-fingerprinting-node-js/#how-does-tls-fingerprinting-work

### Why is this library needed?

With this library you are able to create a http client implementing an interface which is similar to golangs net/http
client interface.
This TLS Client allows you to specify the Client (Browser and Version) you want to use, when requesting a server.

### Supported and tested Clients

- Chrome
    - 103
- Safari
    - 15.3
    - 15.5
- iOS (Safari)
    - 15.5

#### Need other clients?

Please open an issue on this github repository. In the best case you provide the response of https://tls.peet.ws/api/all requested by the client you want to be implemented.

### Quick Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"

	http "github.com/Carcraftz/fhttp"
	tls_client "tls-client"
)

func main() {
	options := []tls_client.HttpClientOption{
		tls_client.WithTimeout(30),
		tls_client.WithClientProfile(tls_client.Chrome_103),
	}

	client, err := tls_client.NewHttpClient(tls_client.NewNoopLogger(), options...)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}

	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "https://tls.peet.ws/api/all", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}

	req.Header = http.Header{
		"accept":                    {"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9"},

		"sec-fetch-site":            {"none"},
		"sec-fetch-user":            {"?1"},
		"upgrade-insecure-requests": {"1"},
		"user-agent":                {"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.75 Safari/537.36"},
		http.HeaderOrderKey: {
			"accept",
			"accept-encoding",
			"accept-language",
			"cache-control",
			"if-none-match",
			"sec-ch-ua",
			"sec-ch-ua-mobile",

			"sec-fetch-user",
			"upgrade-insecure-requests",
			"user-agent",
		},
	}

	resp, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}

	defer resp.Body.Close()

	log.Println(fmt.Sprintf("status code: %d", resp.StatusCode))

	readBytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}

	log.Println(string(readBytes))
}

```

For more configured clients check `./profiles.go`

#### Default Client
The implemented default client is currently Chrome 103 with a configured request timeout of 30 seconds.

### Compile this client for use in Python

TBD

### Compile this client for use in NodeJS

TBD

### Further Information

This library uses the following api: https://tls.peet.ws/api/all to verify the hashes and fingerprints for akamai and
ja3.
